# Land acknowledgement

Before beginning the workshop, we'd like to acknowledge the Indigenous lands upon which our institutions reside.    

[University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/about/land-acknowledgment)

The University of Colorado Boulder, Coloradoâ€™s flagship university, honors and recognizes the many contributions of Indigenous peoples in our state. CU Boulder acknowledges that it is located on the traditional territories and ancestral homelands of the Cheyenne, Arapaho, Ute, and many other Native American nations. Their forced removal from these territories has caused devastating and lasting impacts. While the University of Colorado Boulder can never undo or rectify the devastation wrought on Indigenous peoples, we commit to improving and enhancing engagement with Indigenous peoples and issues locally and globally.
