Now let’s make some changes to the content of the home page. Step 1 . Open index.md and click Edit. Step 2 . Take a minute to modify the content of the homepage. Add some dummy text and perhaps a link. Links look like this: . [dummy text](http://fillerama.io/) . Now let’s talk about Layouts: . You’ve figured out by now that your content pages are saved as Markdown (.md) files. Information like the layout type, title, and navigation (if applicable) are set in the front matter of the page’s markdown file. It looks like this: . --- layout: default title: Home --- . The layouts available will depend on which theme you are using. For this example, we are using the default Jekyll theme, called Minima. When GitHub builds your site, it references the theme indicated in the _config.yml file, which indicates which theme you are using (we will discuss themes more in a minute). Take a look now at the repo that contains the Minima theme. Open the _layouts folder and you can see you have a few different layouts to choose from. Change the layout of your index.md file to home . Tread lightly here… not all themes support different layouts. Many only have one page layout: default . Open your index page in the editor and change the front matter to this: . --- layout: home title: Home --- . Enter a commit message and click Commit. Let your site reload and few the results… . It’s changed! What is all this “Posts” stuff? . Let’s talk about Posts! . Jekyll is a popular platform for blogging, and the “post” layout is fairly common across different Jekyll themes. In your repository, open the _posts folder and you can see that I’ve provided several example posts. Posts must be saved in the _posts folder, and they must always be formatted as yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-post.md. This is how they show up properly in the feed. You must also set the layout as ‘post’ and provide the a category in the front matter, the value of which can be whatever you want. Date is also good: . --- layout: post title: Something smart and academic date: 2021-08-03 categories: science --- . Adjusting Themes . GitHub Pages supports several Standard Themes . Try changing the theme of your site to one of these standard themes. Open your _config.yml file, got to line 33 and change: theme: minima to theme: jekyll-theme-architect . Commit the change and see what happens upon build… . What went wrong? . When switching themes, pay particular attention to the layouts! You may need to check the theme repo to see if it uses the same layouts your pages or posts use (see _layouts folder). If not, you may need to change layouts of your markdown files. Fix it Change the layout of your index.md file to default. 2 Remote Themes . In addition to the standard themes, you can also use “Remote Themes”, of which there are hundreds. GitHub Pages Remote Themes . If you’re relying on remote themes, your mileage may vary here! Be prepared to troubleshoot. Truth: If you want to use themes beyond the standard GH Pages themes, it is best to clone a theme’s repository, work on it locally, and push it to a new remote repository on your GitHub account. This will give you further control over the look and feel of your site and a lot of flexibility… . See Advanced . ",

On Mac OS, this is known as the Terminal and is found in the Applications/Utilities directory. On Windows, this is known as the Command Prompt and can be found under Start&gt;Windows System. Git Bash is also a popular command line interface. Git – Git is a version control software. Many people use Git from the command line, but there is also a desktop GUI interface. Git Repository – A Git repository is essentially an instance of Git version control running in a file directory on your computer. You create a Git repository on your computer by either cloning a repository from GitHub, or by initializing a new repository in a directory (folder) on your computer. On your own computer, this is called a “local repository.” On GitHub, this is referred to as a “remote repository.” See Git Basics. GitHub – (or GitHub.com) GitHub is a free(mium) website for hosting remote Git repositories. It is primarily used for code. GitHub facilitates collaboration by providing access control, task management, bug tracking, and more for all of it’s project repositories. GitHub Pages – GitHub Pages is a built-in function of GitHub that converts a repository into a website. Pages is a very simple method for creating static webpages. Main/Master – The primary repository for a project on GitHub. Formerly named “master”, this was updated to “main” October 1 2020. (Many repositories will still use “master” until updated by their owners.) . Fork – A fork is a remote copy of a GitHub repository. Forking a repository permits others to make changes to a project without modifying the main/master branch of the project. Once forked and modified, changes can be merged with the main/master by way of a Pull Request. Pull Request – A method for suggesting changes to content stored in a GitHub repository. Someone wishing to make a change to a repository can fork the main repository, modify a file(s), and submit a pull request that will be reviewed by the main repository’s owner. If accepted, the changes will be merged with the main repository. Jekyll – Jekyll is a static site generator used for creating a variety of online content. GitHub Pages relies on Jekyll behind the scenes. The site you’re looking at right now was created using Jekyll. Markdown – Markdown is a super-simple markup language. Markdown is popular for creating documentation and readme files. When used in tandem with Jekyll templates, it can be used to generate static web pages. This page was created in Markdown. Ruby – Ruby is an open-source programming language, and is used as a framework for Jekyll. ",

Add is the first step in adding a new file or a modified file into a Git repository. The Add command adds new/modified files to a staging area. Commit (command) – git commit -m \"I made some edits\". Commit is the second step in adding a new/modified file to the Git repository. Commit moves new/modified files from the staging area to the repository. You must include a message following the -m flag. Be sure to make your commit message descriptive in case you need it later. Clone (command) – git clone https://github.com/user/repo-name Make a copy of a remote repository from GitHub.com on your local computer. This is one method of creating a connection between a local and remote repository that you can use to push or pull changes. Pull (command) – git pull origin main Use this to pull updates from the remote repository down to your local copy. Push (command) – git push origin main Use this to push updates made to your local repository to the remote repository.

    "content": "Welcome to the January 2024 Research Data Camp. The Camp is sponsored and organized by the Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship (CRDDS) at the University of Colorado Boulder, and Colorado State University Libraries. It is likely that you will work with research data at some point during the course of your respective graduate programs. The goal of this Research Data Camp is to provide you with an overview of some of the skills, strategies, and best practices that will help you to get started in pursuing this kind of work. The Camp does not presuppose any prior experience in working with research data, and all of the sessions are introductory in nature. Our purpose is not to help you master any given topic, but to provide a useful and productive starting point for further exploration and learning. As you explore further after the Camp and into the semester, we hope you’ll make use of your campus’s many resources, such as opportunities for individual consultations and workshops (many of which will cover the material introduced here in greater depth). More information about these opportunities is provided on the CRDDS and CSU websites. In thinking about the various skills and tasks that are relevant to projects that involve research data, librarians and data professionals often think in terms of a heuristic called the research data lifecycle: . The lifecycle model specifies, in broad terms, the distinct yet interconnected stages of a data-intensive research project; each stage involves a variety of more specific tasks and competencies, as represented in the following graphic from the CRDDS website: . By attending the Camp, our hope is that you will be empowered to navigate the research data lifecycle with respect to your own work, in a deliberate and intentional way. The different sessions of the Research Data Camp address themselves to various stages of this research data lifecycle (italicized words correspond to the stage(s) of the research data lifecycle that the session will emphasize). | The first session, on Data Discovery, will be taught by Liz Novosel (Subject Librarian at CU Boulder Libraries). It will provide you with an introduction to basic strategies for finding data that is relevant to your research needs, and explore basic principles of data ethics that you should consider when working with research data. (Plan; Develop; Publish; Preserve) | The second session, on Data Ethics will be taught by Nickoal Eichmann-Kalwara (Digital Scholarship Librarian at CRDDS) and Katerina Allmendinger (Success and Engagement Librarian at CU Boulder Libraries). It will discuss basic principles of data ethics, with the goal of empowering you to use and create research data in an ethical and responsible manner. (Plan; Develop; Publish; Preserve) | The third session, on Data Publishing and Repositories will be taught by Melissa Cantrell (Scholarly Communication Librarian at CRDDS) and Andrew Johnson (Head of Data and Scholarly Communication Services at CRDDS). It will discuss basic principles of scholarly communication as it relates to data research, and best practices for data archiving (Plan; Publish; Preserve) | The fourth session, on Data Management, will be taught by Mara Sedlins (Research Data Management Specialist at Colorado State University Libraries). It will explore basic principles of data management, and introduce tools for data management and storage. (Plan; Develop; Preserve). | Our fifth session is an Interdisciplinary Tools Tour taught by Nickoal Eichmann-Kalwara. It will survey various useful data-related tools for interdisciplinary research. (Plan; Develop; Publish; Preserve) | The sixth session, on GitHub and GitHub Pages, will be taught by Phil White (Earth Sciences and GIS Librarian at CU Boulder Libraries). It will explore how you can use GitHub and GitHub pages as platforms to collaborate with others, and to share and disseminate your work (Publish; Preserve) | The seventh session, on Data Analysis in R, will be taught by Ellergy Galvin (PhD Student in Applied Mathematics at CU Boulder, and Statistics Specialist at CRDDS). It aims to introduce R novices to useful principles, tools, and packages for data-based research in R/R Studio (Develop). | The eighth and final session will focus on the Python programming language, and will be taught by Kevin Worthington (Maps and GIS Data Specialist at Colorado State University Libraries). The Python Fundamentals session will cover the fundamentals of the Python programming language, while Data Analysis in Python will introduce you to the use of Python for data-based research (Develop). | . We will conclude the Research Data Camp by discussing how you can continue your learning about the various topics introduced at the Bootcamp by participating in CRDDS programs and activities during the fall semester and beyond. We will also discuss the details of the Research Data Camp microcredential, which you can earn by completing a small project that demonstrates your familiarity with the topics presented over the course of the Camp.

Briefly explain the variables (which often correspond to the columns of a conventional tabular data set) you would need to answer your question or test your hypothesis. | Python or R Code and Analysis Outputs: Find a data set that will allow you to explore the question you formulated in (1). Write one script (either an R script or Python Script) that casts light on your question. For example, you might write code that produces a visualization, implements a statistical test, calculates summary statistics, generates a crosstab, or derives a new data set from an existing one (for example, creating a “tidy” data set from an unstructured one). | Please note that you are welcome to write two scripts (one in R and one in Python) if this would help your learning goals, or you would like to demonstrate proficiency in both. However, you are only required to write one. | Please comment your code so that other researchers (or your future self!) can easily follow and understand your script. | Please remember to cite the data set you use in your analysis, as well as other relevant contextual information in the repository’s Readme. | . | Data set Evaluation: A brief (250-500 words) that evaluates a data set with respect to one of the FAIR principles, and best practices for data publishing more generally.

Example 1:Using information from a data set that contains information on the geographic locations of US yoga studios, we might calculate the geographic density of yoga studios with respect to a geographic unit of interest. For our portfolio, we might create a table from this data set (ex. “Census Tracts With Highest Yoga Studio Density per Square Kilometer”), which could be accompanied by a visualization that depicts this variation in density (such as a map or bar chart). The table and visualization, along with the code used to generate them, could be pushed up to your GitHub repository as part of your microcredential portfolio. Example 2:In a data set of snowfall across several ski resorts/areas, we might write code to generate a table of summary statistics (i.e. mean, median, standard deviation etc.) for the snowfall variable (and other variables of interest). Alternatively, we could calculate correlations between variables of interest, or formally test hypotheses using inferential statistics (for example, using a difference of means test or a regression analysis). In this case, the output containing the results of the relevant test(s) (ex. a table of summary statistics, regression table etc.) and the code used to create them would be our portfolio examples. ",
