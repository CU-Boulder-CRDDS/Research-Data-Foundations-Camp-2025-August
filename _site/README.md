# CRDDS Research Data Camp Materials (2024)

This GitHub repository contains materials associated with the Winter 2024 CRDDS Research Data Camp for graduate students, and underpins the corresponding Camp [website](https://cu-boulder-crdds.github.io/RDC_january2024/). 

The template used to create the Camp website was created by [Evan Thornberry](https://github.com/ect123) (UBC) and [Phil White](https://github.com/outpw) (CU Boulder) and presented as part of the Western Association of Map Libraries (WAML) 2020 preconference workshop on teaching with GitHub. For more information on this website template, you can access the template's GitHub [repository](https://github.com/outpw/workshop-template) and the [website rendered from this repository](https://outpw.github.io/workshop-template/).
